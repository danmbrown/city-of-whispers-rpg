## Heat
Your character generates heat by taking risky actions during the game. Heat is a score, like an attribute score, that you sometimes roll with or add to your Sway.
## Ties and Secrets
Someone is a Tie when your character knows something about them, when they have leverage on them. A Secret is a specific piece of information your character has about a Tie.
## Neighborhood Connections
When your character has a connection to a neighborhood it's because they experienced an important moment or event in that neighborhood.

### Histories
You may mark these in any order.

Narrate a flashback showing how in this neighborhood you...
* learned a valuable life lesson
* lost something important, valuable, or sentimental
* sought comfort or refuge from something dangerous
* fell into or out of love
### Demands
These must be marked in order. You may not mark a Demand until you have fulfilled the previous one. When you mark the last one, the city has taken too much from you, and your character must retire.

Describe what the city demands that you do to... 
* fortify something weakened in this neighborhood
* replace something missing in this neighborhood
* build something new in this neighborhood
* remove something ailing this neighborhood
