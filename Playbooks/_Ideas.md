### Apparatus, The Watcher
[[Playbooks/Apparatus]]
The city is a great machine, an intricate connection of cogs and wheels ever ticking through infinite calculations. It would be easy to lose track of everything going on, but not for you.
### Clamor, The Dabbler
[[Playbooks/Clamor]]
The city is your laboratory, and you study everything thing that comes through, a dilittante whose curiosity is matched only by your persistence.
### Conduit, The Connector
[[Playbooks/Conduit]]
The city is the greatest marketplace in the world for goods and information, but without you people wouldn't find each other to make such exchanges.
### Crossroads, The Persuader
[[Playbooks/Crossroads]]
The city overwhelms its inhabitants and you offer them an escape, perhaps providing temporary confections or more permanently giving them purpose anew.
### Foundry, The Crafter
[[Playbooks/Foundry]]
You contribute to the lifeblood of the city, producing goods and services for the enjoyment or satisfaction of others.
### Pillar, The Leader
[[Playbooks/Pillar]]
The city is chaos, a swarming mass without form or direction, unless you command them and direct them.
### Remnant, The Outsider
[[Playbooks/Remnant]]
The city is a maelstrom to the senses, utterly foreign to you in its ways and norms and traditions. 
### Vault, The Patron
[[Playbooks/Vault]]
The city hums with activity, but without your patronage, it would come to a screeching halt.
### Wellspring, The Maven
[[Playbooks/Wellspring]]
The city is a vast library of knowledge, and a small piece of it is yours, but yours alone.
